> Sokoban : Sokoban (warehouse keeper in Japanese) is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. Develop a copy of this game in terminal mode, using the ncurses library.

> Tetris : The goal of this project is to recreate the Tetris game in a UNIX terminal, with the Gameboy version rules. You have to use ncurses.
