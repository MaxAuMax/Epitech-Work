You all know the very famous Battleship game. Well, I hope so.  
You must code a terminal version of this game.  

    • The two players are ONLY allowed to comunicate using the signals SIGUSER1 and SIGUSER2.  
    • The map size is 8x8. On each turn, you must display your positions, and then your enemy’s positions.  
    • At the end of the game (when all the ships of a player have been hit), you must display whether “I won” (and return 0) or “Enemy won” (and return 1).
