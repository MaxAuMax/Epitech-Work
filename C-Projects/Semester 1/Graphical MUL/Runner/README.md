# Runner

In this project, you are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of a finite Endless Running
Game.

The basic rules for the my_runner are as follows:

    • The player is a character who runs in a map you took as parameter.
    • Enemies and obstacles must appear on the opposite side to the player position.
    • The player can use the space bar to jump and avoid obstacles and enemies.
    • As the player runs, a score, which will be displayed, will increase.
    • When the player dies or finishes the map, the score is displayed inside the window.
