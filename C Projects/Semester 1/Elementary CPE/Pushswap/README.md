# Pushswap

The game is made up of two lists of numbers named l_a and l_b.
In the beginning, l_b will be empty and l_a will contain a certain amount of positive or negative numbers.
The objective of the game is to sort l_a.

You must create a program in which l_a is given as parameter (all numbers are valid and can fit in an integer).
The goal is to sort the list by using the fewest possible operations.
The program must print the series of operations that enable this list to be sorted.
