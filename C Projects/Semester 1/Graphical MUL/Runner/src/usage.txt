// My_Runner 2021-2022 \\

The goal of this project is to create a Runner game (such as subway Surfer) with CSFML.
To win a game, you will have to jump over ALL enemies coming in front of you. If you touch them, it's OVER !

USAGE :
>>    ./my_runner src/map/MAP.txt
>>    map1.txt is the easiest, map3.txt is the hardest to finish.

GAME INTEACTIONS :
>>    Play your level with the PLAY button.
>>    SPACE_KEY to jump.
>>    Change your character in the SETTINGS.
>>    Quit the game when you want with the QUIT button.

OTHER INTERACTIONS :
>>    ./my_runner -h        Display this text.
