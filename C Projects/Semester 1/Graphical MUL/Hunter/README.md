In this project, you are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of Duck Hunt.

The basic rules for the my_hunter are as follows:

        •the player is a hunter who shoots ducks.
        •ducks must appear on the screen and move from one side to another.
        •the player can click on them to shoot them.

Being able to manage inputs from the user and to display animated sprites are key skills when you want to develop basic games.
